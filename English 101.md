## 学习方法
- shadowing: This is a technique known as 'shadowing' that I learnt in Japanese class, which I find tremendously helpful for short-term oral fluency improvement. Watch your favorite English language TV show or movie, and as the characters speak, repeat loudly the exact words they are saying the moment you hear them.

- 5w1H: For each job/achievement/education you have experienced/gone through, understand and practice explaining the 5Ws and 1H:
	1. Who was involved.
	2. What happened.
	3. When it happened.
	4. Where it happened.
	5. Why it happened.
	6. How it happened.

## weak points
- member words: reading and writing doesn't mean can recognize when listening. Furthermore, To listen, recognize, translate and understand is a too long process to communicate.
- watching TV Show:   too many slogans. 
- speaking with foreigner(文曲星吵架法):  should be at a relatively intermediate level or else it's impossible to tell, listen and understand. For someone who know lots of words but cannot say and listen.
