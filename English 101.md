## 学习方法
* shadowing: 
	
	This is a technique known as 'shadowing' that I learnt in Japanese class, which I find tremendously helpful for short-term oral fluency improvement. Watch your favorite English language TV show or movie, and as the characters speak, repeat loudly the exact words they are saying the moment you hear them.

- 5w1H: 

	For each job/achievement/education you have experienced/gone through, understand and practice explaining the 5Ws and 1H:
	1. Who was involved.
	2. What happened.
	3. When it happened.
	4. Where it happened.
	5. Why it happened.
	6. How it happened.

* 编故事背单词
	
	把单词编成故事,编故事的过程也是一个学习和记忆的过程.而且这个过程把单词和脑子里已有的记忆网络连接起来.


* 文曲星吵架法: 

	总是练不好英语口语的人，可以试试「文曲星吵架法」 for intermediate learners. 
* 声音优先，情境关联，精深体验，重复莫赶，反馈不断: 英语思维漫谈 （八） 万法归宗

## weak points
- remember words: reading and writing doesn't mean can recognize when listening. Furthermore, To listen, recognize, translate and understand is a too long process to communicate.
- watching TV Show:   too many slogans. 
- speaking with foreigner(文曲星吵架法):  should be at a relatively intermediate level or else it's impossible to tell, listen and understand. For someone who know lots of words but cannot say and listen.
